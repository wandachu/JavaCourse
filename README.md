# Music Note Editor

- This is a gesture based music notation system built with Java, Swing, and Java AWT.
- Gestures are trained by users using pattern recognition AI techiniques and are persisted in the ShapeDB.dat database.
- The Graphical User Interface supports mouse and key activities to allow users to drag and draw specific gestures and input a name. Once gestures are saved, users can drag the gestures to have the corresponding music notion drawn in the editor.
- Same gestures are allowed for different intentions. Elements on the page will listen and "bid" for the gestures and the most relevant one wins.
